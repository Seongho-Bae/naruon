## 2026-06-04 - Add loading state to SearchLayout button
**Learning:** Users notice the little things. Missing loading states on async actions makes users unsure if their action registered. Adding a simple loading spinner provides immediate feedback and aligns with accessibility best practices when making dynamic state changes.
**Action:** Always include a visual loading state like `Loader2` for async actions (like the '발신자 관계 캡처' button) to provide immediate feedback to the user.

## 2024-06-07 - Refactoring CalendarLayout buttons
**Learning:** Raw HTML `<button>` elements with complex Tailwind class strings were scattered throughout layout components, which led to inconsistent hover, focus-visible states, and accessibility properties compared to standard design system components.
**Action:** Replace raw HTML `<button>` tags with the `@/components/ui/button` `Button` component using appropriate variants (`ghost`, `outline`) and sizes (`icon-sm`, `sm`) to instantly standardize accessible focus rings and interaction feedback.

## 2026-06-08 - WorkspaceHome unused import investigation
**Learning:** Investigating unused import reports should first verify the current file because the codebase may already have evolved. The repo lint entrypoint is `eslint`, and the focused check for this investigation was `npx eslint src/components/WorkspaceHome.tsx`.
**Action:** Use the focused `npx eslint src/components/WorkspaceHome.tsx` check when confirming WorkspaceHome import health, and reserve broader `eslint` runs for full frontend lint validation.

## 2024-06-24 - Calendar layout intent action loading feedback
**Learning:** UX feedback shouldn't be forgotten when abstract asynchronous API tasks are handled on secondary pages (like calendar sync coordination). Intent check buttons often block UI interaction context without showing spinning indicators, causing confusion.
**Action:** When inspecting async trigger `<button>` tags specifically using `aria-busy={isLoading}`, make sure there is a complimentary visual indicator like a `lucide-react` `Loader2` element dynamically shown alongside the text.
