## 2026-06-08 - Accessible Search Inputs Across Layouts
**Learning:** Search inputs placed in complex dashboard layouts frequently miss explicitly associated labels and IDs, relying only on placeholders or visual icons, which creates barriers for screen reader users navigating the page landmarks.
**Action:** Always provide a visually hidden `<label>` explicitly tied to the input via `htmlFor` and `id`, and ensure any adjacent decorative search icons have `aria-hidden="true"`.
