# Architecture

```

The backend owns persistence, threading, search, AI summaries, and outbound
send orchestration. The frontend consumes the backend contracts and renders
inbox, detail, thread history, reply composer, and network graph surfaces.

## Threading boundary

`backend/services/threading_service.py` is the canonical domain service for
assigning persisted `thread_id` values. Parsers extract raw email headers, and
import/API paths persist the service-assigned value. The detailed behavior is
documented in `docs/threading-contract.md`.

## Data and tenancy boundary

Email rows are scoped by `emails.user_id`, and email detail, thread, inbox,
search, network graph, import, and threading lookups filter through the current
authenticated user. Cross-user direct object references return 404 for email
detail and thread routes, which avoids disclosing whether another user's email
ID or thread exists.

Local development still uses dummy `X-User-Id` header authentication. Production
deployments must terminate real authentication before the FastAPI app or replace
`backend/api/auth.py` with a verified identity provider; the ownership filters
only protect the boundary once `current_user` is trustworthy.

## Local deployment boundary

`docker-compose.yml` provides the blessed local stack: Postgres with pgvector,
FastAPI backend, and Next.js frontend. The backend bootstrap script creates the
`vector` extension, metadata-defined tables for fresh local databases, and
idempotent owner/threading-column backfills for existing local databases. There
is no Alembic migration history in this repo yet.

## Send boundary

Outbound replies preserve `In-Reply-To` and `References` headers in the built
message payload. Local/dev behavior is explicit: missing SMTP config returns a
400, and simulated send results are marked with `simulated: true` rather than
described as real delivery.

Tenant-configured SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 endpoints are validated before storage
and again immediately before outbound use. The shared mail endpoint policy
allows only service-appropriate mail ports and rejects loopback, private,
link-local, unresolved, or otherwise non-public addresses so tenant settings
cannot drive backend workers toward internal network targets.

## CI security boundary

The Strix workflow treats pull request code as untrusted whenever repository
secrets are available. Privileged PR scans run from `pull_request_target`,
materialize only trusted base content for workflow scripts and dependencies via
the GitHub API, fetch the pull request head as Git objects, and copy changed
PR-head blobs into temporary scan scopes before invoking Strix. Do not checkout
or execute pull request branch scripts in the privileged Strix job.

The gate fails closed when a changed PR-head blob cannot be validated or copied;
it must never fall back to scanning trusted-base content for a modified PR path.
Pull request scans split scoped changed files into small bounded batches before
the timeout-driven rebalance path, so large PRs do not spend the whole required
check budget on one oversized Strix invocation. Strix remains a required
Medium-or-higher gate, while third-party LLM/provider warnings are tracked
separately unless they make the scan incomplete.
Merge-gate governance for Strix, CodeRabbit, and required review evidence is
documented in `docs/development/merge-gate-policy.md`.
