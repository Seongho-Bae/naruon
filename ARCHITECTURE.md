```

The backend owns persistence, threading, search, AI summaries, and outbound
send orchestration. The frontend consumes the backend contracts and renders
inbox, detail, thread history, reply composer, and network graph surfaces.
Runtime database connectivity is secret-injected: `backend/core/config.py` has
no fallback `DATABASE_URL`, so missing database configuration fails at startup
rather than silently using shared development credentials.

## Workspace navigation boundary

The Next.js shell opens the Today execution dashboard for first-run sessions and
lets users explicitly choose Dashboard, Email, or Calendar as their startup
surface. The primary and mobile menus expose Mail, Calendar, Tasks, Projects,
Context Search, AI Hub, Data, Security, and Settings as navigable workspace
destinations, with the tablet/mobile drawer carrying the same global navigation
matrix as the desktop shell. The `/mail`, `/search`, `/calendar`, `/tasks`,
`/projects`, `/ai-hub`, `/data`, `/security`, and `/settings` pages are honest
scope and control-plane surfaces with actionable detail states: CalDAV
month/week/detail/coordination and writeback queues, source-linked task boards,
integrated search results with graph/timeline context, project decision logs,
document repository/ingestion/embedding/quality queues, security policy/audit
surfaces, and operational settings. They expose source-of-truth, duplicate
import/thread provenance, and RBAC/ABAC boundaries without pretending provider
writeback or enterprise identity integrations are fully implemented.

## Threading boundary

`backend/services/threading_service.py` is the canonical domain service for
assigning persisted `thread_id` values. Parsers extract raw email headers, and
import/API paths persist the service-assigned value. The detailed behavior is
documented in `docs/threading-contract.md`.

## Data and tenancy boundary

The `emails` table has non-null `user_id` and `organization_id` owner keys, and
the current email list, detail, thread, search, and network graph endpoints scope
their queries to the authenticated user plus organization. Fresh local databases
get these columns from SQLAlchemy metadata; existing local databases get them
through `scripts/bootstrap_db.py`, which fails closed when legacy rows lack owner
scope unless explicit non-default `NARUON_IMPORT_USER_ID` and
`NARUON_IMPORT_ORGANIZATION_ID` values are provided for the backfill. Production
multi-user safety still requires an audited migration and backfill that maps
historical rows to verified mailbox owners and organizations before real tenant
data is mixed in one database.

`message_id` is unique only within the `(user_id, organization_id)` owner scope,
not globally. Fixture import upserts and reply-thread lookup use the same owner
scope so a reused RFC Message-ID from another organization cannot overwrite an
email row or attach a reply to another tenant's thread.

`llm_providers` is also owner-scoped. Provider rows carry non-null `user_id` and
`organization_id`, provider names are unique only within an organization, and the
registry/list/update/delete plus prompt-preview provider selection paths filter by
the authenticated organization. Existing local databases get the same fail-closed
owner backfill through `scripts/bootstrap_db.py`; legacy provider rows require
explicit non-default `NARUON_IMPORT_USER_ID` and `NARUON_IMPORT_ORGANIZATION_ID`
before bootstrap will set the new columns non-null.

`ticket_tasks` stores email-derived execution items as ticket-like work records.
The table and its new columns use at least two-word `snake_case` database names
such as `task_id`, `task_title`, `status_code`, `priority_code`, `email_id`, and
`thread_id`. The integer `task_id` stays an internal database surrogate; API
responses use the opaque `task_uid` as their public id and expose source message
provenance instead of private foreign keys. Task creation from email always
checks the source email owner scope, copies the canonical thread provenance, and
strips NUL bytes from titles before persistence so malformed LLM/email-derived
strings cannot break PostgreSQL text writes. Because task titles are plain text,
the backend rejects encoded, malformed, or direct HTML-like execution item markup
before storage instead of returning stored tags to a future rendering surface.
Parsed email body/subject, address, and attachment display text strips active
HTML/script markup at the parser boundary while preserving message/thread
identifiers and angle-address headers separately.

Customer-owned mail, CalDAV/CardDAV, and WebDAV systems remain the durable
source-of-truth. Naruon can cache/index metadata and generate writeback intents,
but provider writes must use server-authoritative source records, ownership
checks, and conflict-aware provider revisions such as ETag/If-Match. The detailed
contract is documented in
`docs/operations/source-of-truth-and-writeback-sovereignty.md`.
Frontend calendar actions follow the same boundary: `EmailDetail` requests
`/api/calendar/writeback-intent` per extracted execution item and reports source
provenance, while legacy `/api/calendar/sync` remains fail-closed unless a
trusted backend credential dependency supplies an authorized provider token.

Authorization is RBAC plus ABAC with deny precedence. Data-region, consent,
workspace, group, source capability, and customer-policy denies still override
broad roles. The narrow exception is an explicitly RBAC-permitted
`platform_admin`: that role may cross organization and resource ownership
boundaries in the pure access-policy evaluator for platform operations, but it
does not bypass data-region or consent denies; see
`docs/operations/auth-key-management.md`.

## Local deployment boundary

`docker-compose.yml` provides the blessed local stack: Postgres with pgvector,
FastAPI backend, and Next.js frontend. The backend bootstrap script creates the
`vector` extension, metadata-defined tables for fresh local databases, and
idempotent threading-column backfills for existing local databases. There is no
Alembic migration history in this repo yet.

## Send boundary

Outbound replies preserve `In-Reply-To` and `References` headers in the built
message payload. Local/dev behavior is explicit: missing SMTP config returns a
400, and simulated send results are marked with `simulated: true` rather than
described as real delivery.

Tenant-provided SMTP destinations are not a general outbound socket primitive.
`backend/api/tenant_config.py`, `backend/api/emails.py`, and the final
`backend/services/email_client.py` network sink enforce the operator-controlled
`ALLOWED_SMTP_HOSTS` and `ALLOWED_SMTP_PORTS` allowlists. The service also
rejects loopback, link-local, private, reserved, and otherwise non-global DNS
answers before opening a pinned socket to the selected global address, so stale
database rows or direct service calls fail closed instead of reaching internal
network targets or re-resolving DNS after validation.

Private-network IMAP/SMTP/CalDAV/CardDAV/WebDAV access belongs behind the
outbound-only self-hosted connector boundary. GitHub self-hosted runners can
smoke-test internal mail connectivity, but production relay/proxy access should
use a connector artifact and never imply inbound MX hosting.

LLM provider `base_url` is also a server-side egress boundary, not an arbitrary
URL field. Provider registry create/update paths are organization-admin scoped,
and LLM call sinks validate custom OpenAI-compatible base URLs with HTTPS-only
syntax, no userinfo/query or fragment, exact host membership in
`ALLOWED_LLM_BASE_URL_HOSTS`, and DNS answers that are all globally routable.
Missing allowlist configuration fails closed; the default provider path should
leave `base_url` unset.

## CI security boundary

The Strix workflow treats pull request code as untrusted whenever repository
secrets are available. Privileged PR scans run from `pull_request_target`,
materialize only trusted base content for workflow scripts and dependencies via
the GitHub API, fetch the pull request head as Git objects, and copy changed
PR-head blobs into temporary scan scopes before invoking Strix. When a changed
file is also included as backend context for another batch, the scope still uses
the PR-head blob rather than trusted-base content, so a security fix is not
re-scanned against stale vulnerable context. Do not checkout or execute pull
request branch scripts in the privileged Strix job.

The gate fails closed when a changed PR-head blob cannot be validated or copied;
it must never fall back to scanning trusted-base content for a modified PR path.
Pull request scans split scoped changed files into small bounded batches before
the timeout-driven rebalance path, so large PRs do not spend the whole required
check budget on one oversized Strix invocation. Strix remains a required
Medium-or-higher gate. The workflow uses only the explicit
`STRIX_OPENAI_API_KEY` OpenAI Platform credential with an OpenAI
GPT-5.4-or-newer model, rejects GitHub Models routing and `github.token` LLM
credentials, and fails closed when direct credentials are missing or exhausted.
Merge-gate governance for Strix, CodeRabbit, and required review evidence is
documented in `docs/development/merge-gate-policy.md`.

## Release and operations boundary

Release/deployment architecture is documented in
`docs/operations/release-deployment-architecture.md`. Naruon is not an email
server; the email boundary is a web client relay/proxy for member-configured
SMTP/IMAP providers as documented in
`docs/operations/email-relay-proxy-boundary.md`. PostgreSQL is single-primary in
the current repo and physical replication/WAL restore remain future work per
`docs/operations/postgresql-physical-replication.md`.

Authentication does not treat public `X-User-*`, `X-Organization-*`,
`X-Group-*`, or `X-Dev-Auth-Token` headers as identity material. The runtime
FastAPI dependency in `backend/api/auth.py` accepts only `Authorization: Bearer`
compact session tokens whose protected header pins `alg=HS256` and whose
`header.payload` signing input is signed by the configured
`AUTH_SESSION_HMAC_SECRET`; missing, weak, malformed, legacy two-segment,
wrong-algorithm, tampered, expired, or public fixture-secret tokens fail closed
with 401. The signed session envelope must carry explicit identity, role,
organization/group, and workspace claims, so user ids such as `admin` do not
imply elevated privileges.
Endpoint tests use FastAPI dependency overrides for fixture identity only through
explicit opt-in pytest fixtures, while a full Keycloak/Casdoor/OIDC provider and
audited mailbox-owner migration remain required before production multi-user
access is claimed; see `docs/operations/auth-key-management.md`. The current
Kubernetes ingress assumes NGINX, while Traefik is only an evaluated option in
`docs/operations/traefik-evaluation.md`.

Private `/api/*` routers are also registered in `backend/main.py` with the
default `get_auth_context` dependency so newly added private endpoints inherit a
signed-session requirement before endpoint-specific user, organization, role, or
resource checks run. `/api/runtime-config`, `/`, and `/metrics` remain public
because they expose only non-secret runtime/health metadata. LLM provider
registry reads and writes are organization/platform admin operations; members use
tenant-scoped configuration or approved AI workflows rather than provider
inventory APIs. Provider rows remain scoped to the authenticated organization for
ordinary provider registry operations and prompt-preview model selection. Custom
provider endpoints additionally require an operator-owned egress allowlist so an
organization admin cannot point LLM traffic at localhost, private networks, or
cloud metadata services.

The browser API client reads `naruon_session_token` from local storage and sends
it as the bearer session on signed routes. It does not synthesize or forward
public identity headers such as `X-User-Id`, `X-Organization-Id`, `X-Group-Id`,
`X-Group-Ids`, `X-User-Role`, or `X-Dev-Auth-Token`; any local development
identity-header flow is limited to explicit unsigned/test harness paths and is
not accepted by authenticated runtime dependencies. UI flows that create
source-linked tasks or other server-side writes must keep that signed-session
path covered in fast tests and E2E mocks so authenticated backend behavior is
not masked by stale fixtures.
Caller-supplied `Authorization` headers are dropped before the stored signed
session is applied, so browser code cannot shadow the bearer token with a
case-variant header.

Secret-field encryption has no code fallback key. `backend/db/models.py` requires
an explicit, valid Fernet `ENCRYPTION_KEY` before encrypting or decrypting OAuth,
OpenAI, SMTP, IMAP, Google, and runner registration token fields, even in debug
mode. Invalid passphrase-style keys fail closed instead of being transformed into
derived keys. Decryption failures return `None` rather than ciphertext, so routes
that touch encrypted values must surface operator-facing missing-key or
unavailable-secret behavior without exposing encrypted blobs.

Calendar writeback intent selection is server-authoritative. The
`/api/calendar/writeback-intent` request may specify an action and optional
target source id, but it must not provide source ownership or capability records;
`backend/api/calendar.py` obtains writeback sources through a FastAPI dependency
that is empty by default until a connector/source registry supplies trusted
records scoped to the authenticated user.
