## 2024-05-24 - Overly Permissive CORS Policy

**Vulnerability:** The CORS configuration in FastAPI allowed wildcards (`*`) for `allow_methods` and `allow_headers`.
**Learning:** This could permit unintended cross-origin interaction, potentially exposing the API to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or unintended data exposure, particularly via custom headers or unconventional methods.
**Prevention:** Always restrict `allow_methods` and `allow_headers` in CORS policies to the exact methods and headers required by the application.
## 2026-05-28 - Missing Next.js Security Headers
**Vulnerability:** The Next.js frontend was missing critical HTTP security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security).
**Learning:** Security headers should be explicitly configured in Next.js applications via the `headers()` method in `next.config.ts`, as they are not included by default.
**Prevention:** Always enforce a strong CSP and other security headers at the application framework level, even if the application is purely API-driven.
