## 2024-05-24 - Overly Permissive CORS Policy

**Vulnerability:** The CORS configuration in FastAPI allowed wildcards (`*`) for `allow_methods` and `allow_headers`.
**Learning:** This could permit unintended cross-origin interaction, potentially exposing the API to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or unintended data exposure, particularly via custom headers or unconventional methods.
**Prevention:** Always restrict `allow_methods` and `allow_headers` in CORS policies to the exact methods and headers required by the application.
