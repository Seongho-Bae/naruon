## 2024-05-24 - Overly Permissive CORS Policy

**Vulnerability:** The CORS configuration in FastAPI allowed wildcards (`*`) for `allow_methods` and `allow_headers`.
**Learning:** This could permit unintended cross-origin interaction, potentially exposing the API to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or unintended data exposure, particularly via custom headers or unconventional methods.
**Prevention:** Always restrict `allow_methods` and `allow_headers` in CORS policies to the exact methods and headers required by the application.
## 2026-05-28 - Missing Next.js Security Headers
**Vulnerability:** The Next.js frontend was missing critical HTTP security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security).
**Learning:** Security headers should be explicitly configured in Next.js applications via the `headers()` method in `next.config.ts`, as they are not included by default.
**Prevention:** Always enforce a strong CSP and other security headers at the application framework level, even if the application is purely API-driven.

## 2025-02-24 - [DAV Path Traversal Vulnerability]
**Vulnerability:** A path traversal vulnerability existed in the `/dav/{path:path}` endpoint where `_dav_path_owner_user_id` extracted the owner user ID using `path.partition("/")` without validating or normalizing `..` segments.
**Learning:** This allowed an attacker to supply a path like `my_user_id/../other_user_id/projects`, tricking the authorization check `_ensure_dav_owner_scope` into passing because the first segment matched their authenticated `user_id`. The remaining path could then be used downstream to access resources of `other_user_id`. When testing this against FastAPI's TestClient, the TestClient normalizes `../` automatically; `..%2F` must be used to test the router correctly.
**Prevention:** Always validate or normalize dynamic paths used for authorization constraints, explicitly rejecting paths containing traversal segments like `..` before parsing hierarchical data.
## 2025-06-19 - Inconsistent Authorization in AI Hub

**Vulnerability:** The AI Hub's list prompts endpoint (`_list_prompts` in `backend/api/ai_hub.py`) strictly filtered returned prompts by `created_by == auth_context.user_id`, ignoring the `is_shared` property which allows a prompt to be accessed globally. This resulted in a failure of access control policies because shared resources were effectively hidden from the surface, while directly accessible through other APIs.
**Learning:** Authorization and resource filtering must be consistently scoped across the system. Inconsistency leads to functional security bugs where visibility does not match explicit intent (e.g. sharing).
**Prevention:** Unify queries regarding scoping (e.g., using centralized helper functions for where-clauses) instead of redefining conditions per-endpoint. When creating models with boolean overrides for visibility like `is_shared`, ensure all read paths respect them.
