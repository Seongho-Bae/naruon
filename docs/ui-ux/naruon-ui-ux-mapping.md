# Naruon UI/UX Definition & Mapping

## 1. Overview
Naruon is an **Evidence-based AI Email Workspace**. The core objective of the UI/UX is not to simply act as an email client or AI summarization tool, but to synthesize email, attachments, images, calendars, relations, and project contexts based on evidence to assist users in judgment and execution.

## 2. Core Philosophy & UI Terminology
Naruon's UX strictly follows three principles:
1. **Do not just shorten emails. Connect the context.**
2. **AI does not just state conclusions. It presents evidence and confidence.**
3. **Judgments must lead to execution.**

### Terminology Rules
The UI must use specific terminology to reflect this philosophy:
* ❌ AI Summary -> ⭕ 맥락 종합 (Context Synthesis)
* ❌ Summary -> ⭕ 종합, 핵심 맥락 (Synthesis, Core Context)
* ❌ Insight -> ⭕ 판단 포인트 (Decision Point)
* ❌ Todo -> ⭕ 실행 항목 (Action Item)
* ❌ Smart Reply -> ⭕ 답장 초안 (Draft Reply)
* ❌ Search -> ⭕ 맥락 검색 (Context Search)
* ❌ Network Graph -> ⭕ 관계 맥락 (Relation Context)
* ❌ Calendar Sync -> ⭕ 일정 반영 (Reflect Calendar)
* ❌ AI Assistant -> ⭕ 판단 보조 (Judgment Assist)

## 3. Core GNB & UI Organization

## 4. UI Design Mockups (Phase 1 & 2)
All Naruon UI/UX visual source material is consolidated under `docs/ui-ux/`. This directory is the unified asset repository for front-end implementation, PR reviews, and LLM Agent handoff. Keep the existing image paths stable: the dated reference set has SHA-256 provenance, while `mockups/` remains the canonical design image set.

**Unified UI/UX Asset Repository:** `docs/ui-ux/`
* **Agent text map:** `docs/ui-ux/naruon-ui-ux-mapping.md`
* **Canonical mockup image set:** `docs/ui-ux/mockups/`
* **Durable reference image set:** `docs/ui-ux/reference-set-2026-06-18/images/`

**LLM Agent instruction:** An LLM Agent implementing or reviewing Naruon UI must first read this text map, then directly open the relevant original image files under `docs/ui-ux/mockups/` and `docs/ui-ux/reference-set-2026-06-18/images/` to verify layout, spacing, visual hierarchy, state chips, and annotated button flows. The descriptions below are a text navigation aid for agents that cannot see the figures immediately; they do not replace the source PNG files.

한국어 요지: LLM Agent는 이 파일의 설명만으로 판단하지 말고, 구현 또는 리뷰 대상과 관련된 `mockup_XX.png` 또는 `ui-ux-reference-XX.png` 원본 그림 파일을 직접 열어 화면 구성과 상호작용 주석을 확인해야 한다.

*Note: The mockups contain design definitions for the components above and must be translated into the Naruon Design System following the Evidence-based UI principles (confidence intervals, citation binding, and human correction UI).*

### 4.1 Common Visual Structure
The mockups use a quiet workbench layout rather than a marketing layout. Most desktop screens follow a 3-column shell:

1. **Global navigation:** Naruon logo on the left, top GNB items for Home, Mail, Calendar, Project, Data, AI Hub, Security, and Settings, plus global search, notifications, app switcher/help, and profile controls on the right.
2. **Local navigation:** A left sidebar lists the current domain's folders, filters, saved views, labels, and support/help controls.
3. **Primary work area:** The center area carries the active list, calendar, editor, canvas, table, or search result.
4. **Evidence or action panel:** The right side is often a detail drawer or AI/evidence panel showing source metadata, confidence, related people, attached files, schedule proposals, decision points, risks, and executable actions.
5. **Evidence-based UI language:** Repeated building blocks include `맥락 종합`, `판단 포인트`, `실행 항목`, confidence badges, source chips, relation graphs, timelines, priority/status chips, and buttons that turn judgment into calendar, reply, task, or approval actions.

### 4.3 Reference Set File Map

`docs/ui-ux/reference-set-2026-06-18/` is a durable 45-image reference set captured for the June 18, 2026 PR review cycle. Its `README.md` lists the image set, and `sources.tsv` records each reference file's stable SHA-256 digest and repository path. Use `sources.tsv` to verify reference-set file integrity before assuming that a copied or renamed image is the same asset.

The reference set contains four additional button-action maps plus 41 visual/semantic equivalents of the mockup files above. Exact binary hashes should be checked before deduplicating files; when two files are confirmed identical, reuse the existing description instead of writing a second long description. For this mapping document, the 41 repeated concepts are intentionally represented as aliases to the existing mockup descriptions.
